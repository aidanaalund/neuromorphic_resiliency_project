# neuromorphic_resiliency_project
Scripts and code for my research project as an undergraduate research assistant in the SLAM lab at UT Austin. Porting spiking neural networks (SNNs) to a custom neuromorphic hardware simulator for design exploration and testing resiliency through methods like fault injection.
