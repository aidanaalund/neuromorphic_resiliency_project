# Neuromorphic Resiliency Project
Scripts and code for my research project as an undergraduate research assistant in the SLAM lab at UT Austin. Porting spiking neural networks (SNNs) to a C++ neuromorphic hardware simulator for design exploration. In later stages of the project I will test simulated neuromorphic HW resiliency through methods like fault injection.
